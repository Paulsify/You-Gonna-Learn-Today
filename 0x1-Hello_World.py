'print' is a function meaning that it is a bit of code that does something or has a 'function'. (get it ?)
'print' in python as with many other languages will print out data to your screen. 

This function will print out anything in the parentheses(). The parentheses are required for the print function work

There are different types of data you can print out using the print function. 

Something in quotes is called a 'string' that just means its a group of letters instead of say numbers

you can also print numbers but dont include the qoutes for numbers

Please refer to the Data_Types file to see more

"""

print("Hello, World !") # This will print; Hello, World ! To use strings it must be in quotes either single or double.

print('"Hello, World !"') # This will print; "Hello, World !" Notice that the double quotes are included.

print("'Hello, World !'") # This will print; 'Hello, World !' Notice that this time it is the single quotes are inlcuded.

#In python double quotes and single quotes are virutually the same and indicate that whats inside is stored as a string.

print ('Hello, World ! ' * 5) #Anything outside quotes will be also be printed as such, * 5 means multiply by 5 so this will multiply Hello World ! times 5 and thus print it out 5 times
